# FinalProject

This repository contains the code for the final project of numerical analysis course. Simulating a simple detector.


## 📁 Structure

- `main.py`: Main execution script
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for detectors and plot settings
- `utils/`: Contains modules for fitting(`fit_utils.py`), evaluation(`evaluation.py`), file I/O(`data_io.py`)
- `models/`: Contains classes for detector modules and particles
- `data/`: Contains output .csv file


## 📝 Memo

- `PCA_Linear` is about comparing PCA and Least Squases Fitting Method

  (Now Using Least Squares Fitting)

  (May have bug in PCA? Sometime very large, detector reason?) 

- `Example` include the way of using some classes and function.
